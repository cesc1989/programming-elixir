# Testing

Mix automatically includes a line called `doctest Animals`. What this means is that it can run tests from the examples in the documentation that you write for your functions.

Run tests with `mix test`.

**NOTICE**

**You do not need to install and require any external testing frameworks**. It all comes with the Elixir package. Simply write test followed by a string representing what you are trying to test and then write your assertion.
