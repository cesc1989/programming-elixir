# Why, What, and More

Notes from [Learn Elixir](https://github.com/dwyl/learn-elixir).

## Advantages of Using Elixir

- Scalability
- Speed
- Compiled and run on the Erlanv Virtual Machine, BEAM. [Well renowned for efficiency](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16779162/what-kind-of-virtual-machine-is-beam-the-erlang-vm).
- Better _garbage collectio_ than any other VM.
- Many tiny processes > thread
- Real time apps are "easy" to build compared to other programming languages. WebSockets and Streaming by default.

**Important**

> Things will go wrong with code, and Elixir provides supervisors which describe how to restart parts of your system when things don't go as planned.
