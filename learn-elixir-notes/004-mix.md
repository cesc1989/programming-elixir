# Generate Projects with Mix

To get started with your first Elixir project you need to make use of the [Mix build tool](https://hexdocs.pm/mix/Mix.html) that comes straight out of the box. Mix allows you to do a number of things including:

- Create projects
- Compile projects
- Run tasks
  - Testing
  - Generate documentation
- Manage dependencies

Create a project with

```
$ mix new PROJECT_NAME
```

The command will create several files and folders to bootstrap the project with a good foundation for us.

## Test Project

Let's test out the boilerplate code. In your project directory type the following command:

```
$ iex -S mix
```

What this basically means is, "Start the elixir interactive terminal and compile with the context of my current project". This allows you to access modules and functions created within the file tree.

```elixir
iex(1)> Animals.hello
:world
```

## Notes After Writing the Animals module

To run our new code we will first have to recompile our `iex`.

```elixir
iex> recompile
```

It's convention when writing a function that returns a boolean to add a question mark after the name of the method.

The [`case` expression](https://elixir-lang.org/getting-started/case-cond-and-if.html) here allows us to pattern match against various options and react accordingly.

### The Pipe Operator

It takes the value returned from the expression and passes it down as the first argument in the expression below.
